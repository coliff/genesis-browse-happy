# Genesis Browse Happy

Inspired by the [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate), this is a super simple plugin which will add a notice to the top of your website if a visitor is using Internet Explorer 9 or below, advising them that they are using an outdated browser and to visit [Browse Happy](http://browsehappy.com) to upgrade.

It also enqueues a tiny stylesheet (again only loaded by users of IE9 or below) which gives the notice some simple styling.

_Note. This plugin is designed for use with the Genesis Framework only. It uses the `genesis_before` hook to output the notice._
